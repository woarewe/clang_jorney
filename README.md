# My C knowledge refreshing

I studied C/C++ in university, I really like this two languages and
planned to found job on this technologies but sometime I saw Ruby and now it is my favorite language.
I love it very much! Because Ruby is the programmer's best friend :)
But, I think, you have a question, why does this repo present?
I understand how works C, how works memory, pointers, process, forks, linux threads,
and other low-level processes, it gives me
serious understanding how ruby works under hood.
But I'm nerb, I wanna understand some things of Ruby better.
This repos was created for refreshing specific things of C.
I reread book "The C programming language, 2nd Edition" and save all samples and my journey and experiments here :)
